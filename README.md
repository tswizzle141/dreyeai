### Description :
Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. We hope to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct.<br>
We are going to build a machine learning model to speed up disease detection.We have to work with thousands of images collected in rural areas to help identify diabetic retinopathy automatically.

### Data Description :
Large set of retina images taken using fundus photography under a variety of imaging conditions. A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:
+ 0 - No DR
+ 1 - Mild
+ 2 - Moderate
+ 3 - Severe
+ 4 - Proliferative DR

Our team has used the Dataset from Kaggle.

The motivations for this project are twofold:

* Image classification has been a personal interest for years, in addition to classification on a large scale data set.

* Time is lost between patients getting their eyes scanned (shown below), having their images analyzed by doctors, and scheduling a follow-up appointment. By processing images in real-time, ResNet would allow people to seek & schedule treatment the same day.

### Results

Accuracy Test: around 70%

### Workflow

1. Sign-up & Log-in form

2. Patient Information

3. Take OCT photo and diagnose

4. Diagnosis and RD Classification


5. Save the result into Patient's National Online Case-Record
